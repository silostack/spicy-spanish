Spicy Spanish Website – Full Technical Specifications
1. Overview and Objectives
Project Summary:
Build a unified, responsive web application that serves as the public-facing site and the administrative dashboard for Carla’s Spanish language school. The platform will support three roles (Carla [admin], tutors, and students) and combine informational pages with scheduling, payments, and course management. Its core goals include ease of use, maintainability, and a warm, fun design aligned with the “Spicy Spanish” brand.

Primary Objectives:

Centralize scheduling, payments, and course management into one system.

Allow role-based access: students self-register and manage their profiles, tutors provide their availability, and Carla manages transactions and course assignments.

Integrate essential third-party services (Stripe, Solana-based crypto, Google Calendar, Google Analytics).

Implement automated notifications and basic analytics with minimal but extensible code and documentation.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Roles & Authentication
User Types:

Carla (Admin): Full control of all areas including tutor and student profiles, scheduling, transactions, email notifications, course assignments, and analytics.

Tutors: Can create and update their profile, set availability, and view assigned student schedules.

Students: Can self-register, edit their own profile, purchase classes, view their transaction history, download invoices, and view a visual calendar of their scheduled classes.

Authentication & Permissions:

Registration & Logins:

Students: Self-register using standard forms. After registration, an email is sent to Carla notifying her of the new student.

Tutors: Registration via manual invitation process. Carla sends an invitation email that includes a registration link (with a token) so the tutor can set a password and complete their profile.

Carla: Admin account(s) with permissions to override or edit any student or tutor information.

Permissions:

Students can modify only their own profile.

Tutors can modify only their own profile and set their availability.

Only Carla can edit transaction records and assign students to tutors.

Use best practices for role-based access control (RBAC) to secure endpoints appropriately.

3. Core Feature Modules
3.1 Scheduling & Calendar
Availability Setup:

Tutors can set recurring or one-off available time slots.

Integration with external calendars (Google Calendar preferred). Allow tutors and students to sync/update events.

Visual Calendar:

A dynamic calendar view that adjusts to each user’s local time zone.

Automatic detection of timezone using browser settings on registration and options for manual adjustment.

Consider Daylight Saving Time adjustments, especially since most tutors are in Colombia and many students in the U.S.

Scheduling functionality becomes available only after Carla assigns a student to a tutor.

3.2 Payment and Transaction Management
Payment Processing:

Stripe Integration: Use Stripe Checkout with a custom-built page.

Toggle between traditional credit card processing and crypto payments.

For credit cards: display fields for card details.

For crypto: enable wallet connection (using the Solana blockchain) for payment submission.

Alternate Payment Methods:

Manual updates for payments made via Zelle or PayPal.

Real-time integration where possible to automatically update purchased hours.

Transaction Records & Invoicing:

Students have access to a personal transaction history.

Invoice generation (downloadable as PDF) and automated emails when an invoice is sent.

Carla can add/edit/delete transaction records manually (without notifying the student).

Package Management:

An interface for Carla to create/edit class packages (hours and pricing).

Ability to update the number of purchased hours manually, with automatic email notifications to Carla for every new payment.

3.3 Course & Curriculum Management
Course Assignment:

Carla can build courses (or series of courses) and assign them to students.

A basic “curriculum builder” module where Carla can:

Create or modify course outlines.

Associate courses with a tutor when a student is assigned.

The system should be flexible enough to support future enhancements similar to Ayotree’s curriculum features.

Suggestion: Build a simple modular course editor now, with fields for course title, description, lesson outlines, and assignment status. This can be extended later for more advanced curriculum building.

3.4 Email Notifications & Templating
Triggers & Templates:

New Student Registration: An automated email is sent to Carla.

Tutor Invitation: Email to tutors with invitation link and registration instructions.

Payment Notification: Carla gets notified for every payment made.

Class Reminder: Automated email notification to students one hour before their class starts. This feature is configurable (enable/disable).

Admin Panel: Provide an admin panel in Carla’s dashboard to customize email templates and scheduling settings. Templates will be in English only.

Templating System:

Use a server-side templating engine (e.g., Handlebars or similar) for email formats.

Prepare default templates that can be modified via the admin panel.

4. Technical Architecture
4.1 Frontend
Framework: Next.js

Design & UI Guidelines:

Branding and Look:

Warm and fun aesthetic with a spicy feel (focus on reds and oranges).

Reference: Magic Spoon for inspiration, but with a design that accentuates the “Spicy Spanish” brand.

Responsive, mobile-first design ensuring usability across devices.

Use smooth, engaging transitions without overcomplicating the UI.

Pages & Components:

Public-facing Pages: Home, About, Tutor Listing (team page with simple list view; Carla’s profile at the top), Contact.

User Dashboard: Separate dashboards for students, tutors, and Carla (Admin).

Calendar view, profile settings, payment history, course assignments.

Checkout Page: Dynamic interface toggling between credit card and crypto payment (Solana blockchain integration).

Google Analytics Integration: Embed Google Tag Manager on the frontend for tracking.

4.2 Backend
Framework: Nest.js

Database: PostgreSQL, accessed via Mikro-ORM.

Architecture and Code Organization:

Follow a clean, modular monolithic pattern.

Structure the codebase with clearly separated controllers, services, DAOs, and a domain/entity model.

Keep interfaces and critical service endpoints well documented with minimal inline documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc style) where necessary.

Configuration:

Use a .env file to manage configuration variables (mail settings, database connection, Stripe API keys, etc.).

Support multiple environments (development/production) with conditional settings such as enabling CORS in development.

Job Scheduling & Email Services:

Use Nest.js’s built-in scheduling features to handle email reminders and periodic tasks.

Integrate a lightweight email templating system for dynamic content in emails.

API Endpoints:

Authentication endpoints for user registration, login, and profile updates.

Endpoints for scheduling (CRUD operations on appointments, availability, and calendar events).

Payment endpoints to facilitate Stripe and crypto payment processing.

Administrative endpoints for transaction management, course assignments, and email template customization.

5. UI/UX Design Guidelines
5.1 Look and Feel
Overall Aesthetic:

Warm, fun, and engaging with a “spicy” visual vibe.

Settings Panel:

Configure email templates, scheduling parameters, and other system settings.

6. Extensibility and Future-Proofing
Modular Components:

Design all major components (user management, scheduling, payments, courses) as modular so they can be extended or swapped out for new features (e.g., future CRM integration).

Documentation & Code Practices:

Minimal but clear inline documentation for major modules and interfaces.

Document key service interfaces and APIs to support future developer onboarding.

Use well-established design patterns to simplify future integrations (e.g., a modular service interface for payment processors to add other channels).

Future Integrations:

Prepare the course/curriculum module for future expansion (potentially integrating more features from Ayotree’s curriculum builder).

Design the system to allow additional content sections (blogs, resource pages) with minimal changes.

7. Deployment and Configuration
Environment Management:

Use a .env file for all configuration (development, staging, production).

Enable CORS only in development; production should strictly limit origins.

Build & Deployment:

Use CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and tests.

Code should run on standard Node.js runtime environments.

Database migrations and backups handled via Mikro-ORM’s built-in mechanisms.

Monitoring and Analytics:

Integrate basic logging using Nest.js logging modules.

Google Analytics via Google Tag Manager on the frontend to capture visitor activity and engagement.

8. Final Guidance for the LLM Developer
When you begin developing the system, please assume the role of a masterful engineer and UI designer. Here are a few key points to drive the implementation:

Code Organization: Keep the codebase simple and monolithic for now. Focus on clear separation of concerns within controllers, services, and DAOs.

UI/UX Excellence: The site should immediately feel friendly, warm, and engaging. Follow the design cues from Magic Spoon but align with a spicy, red-orange theme.

Extensibility: Build a modular system that can accommodate future integrations (like additional payment gateways, advanced course building, or CRM integration).

Testing & Best Practices: Ensure that all critical services (authentication, scheduling, and payment processing) are well-tested. Write testable, clean code and use industry best practices.

Documentation & Maintainability: Provide minimal but clear documentation on major service interfaces and configuration settings to allow future developers to extend and maintain the system.
